Rum raisin. Obvs.

Natalia: Having moved to London from Canada two years ago, Natalia has finally found her true passion: coding. At the age of 16 she started her own clothing and fashion brand. Out of pure boredom, she become a bartender and also managed a small boutique for her friend. After a couple years doing this the boredom hadn’t subsided. On a whim she booked a flight to Florence, Italy and backpacked solo for six months. She ended up in London where she has studied Psychology at Birkbeck and run a Boutique in Shoreditch. It took her far too long to find her terminal in her computer and get coding. Her favourite ice cream: Cookie Dough and Mint Oreo

Subhan is originally from Pakistan, was born and raised in German and studies in the UK. This international mix allowed her to understand both the eastern and western world, which might have also sparked her love for exploring different cultures, places and cuisines. She just completed her Master’s in Business Psychology at UCL and is looking to start her own business in the future:
Favourite Ice Cream? The best ice cream flavour is called ‘Snowflake’ from Snowflake Gelato which is made out of vanilla ice cream, coconut and white chocolate pieces.
