Having moved to London from Canada two years ago, <strong>Natalia</strong> has finally found her true passion: coding. At the age of 16 she started her own clothing and fashion brand. Out of pure boredom, she become a bartender and also managed a small boutique for her friend. After a couple years doing this the boredom hadn’t subsided. On a whim she booked a flight to Florence, Italy and backpacked solo for six months. She ended up in London where she has studied Psychology at Birkbeck and run a Boutique in Shoreditch. It took her far too long to find her terminal in her computer and get coding. <br></br> <br></br>
